/* Questions 
1) With code examples, explain let, var and const keywords.
2) Create a variable called z, assign x + y to it, and display the result in an alert box.
3) Display the sum of 5 + 10, using two variables: x and y.
4) Create a variable called carName, assign the value Volvo to it.
5) What error message do you get when you try to redeclare a variable stored with let and const 
6) What error message is displayed when you try to access the block scope variables outside the block ?


1) var can be redeclared and assigned :
var x = 7;
var x = 8;
x = 9;
consolog.log(x);
It will log 9.

let cannot be redeclared but can be reassigned :
let x = 7;
x = 8;
consolog.log(x);
It will log 8.
const cannot be redeclared or reassigned because these variables are constant :
const x = 7;
x = 8; 
consolog.log(x);
This will throw a SyntaxError 

2) let z = x + y;
  alert(z);

3) let x = 5;
let y = 10;
Let sum = x + y;
consolog.log(sum);

4) let carName = Volvo;

5) SyntaxError

6)  ReferenceError */
